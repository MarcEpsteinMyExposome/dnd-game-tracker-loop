# RETROSPECTIVE: Lessons Learned

**Project:** dnd-game-tracker-loop v2.0
**Purpose:** Document insights and learnings after each iteration

---

## How to Use This File

After completing each loop iteration:
1. Review what happened during the iteration
2. Document what went well
3. Document what could be improved
4. Capture specific lessons learned
5. Note any process adjustments for next iteration

## Template for Future Retrospectives

```markdown
## Loop Iteration X: [Name]

**Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Duration:** X days
**Tasks Completed:** X of Y

### What Went Well ✅
- [Positive aspect 1]
- [Positive aspect 2]
- [Positive aspect 3]

### What Could Be Improved 🔄
- [Challenge or issue 1]
- [Challenge or issue 2]
- [Challenge or issue 3]

### Specific Lessons Learned 💡
1. **[Lesson title]**
   - Situation: [What happened]
   - Learning: [What we learned]
   - Action: [How to apply this going forward]

2. **[Lesson title]**
   - Situation: [What happened]
   - Learning: [What we learned]
   - Action: [How to apply this going forward]

### Process Observations 📊
- **Task breakdown:** [Too granular? Too broad? Just right?]
- **Time estimates:** [Accurate? Way off?]
- **Blockers:** [What blocked progress and how resolved?]
- **Testing approach:** [Did TDD work? Coverage adequate?]
- **Commit frequency:** [Too often? Not enough?]

## General Observations (Ongoing)

### About the Loop Methodology
*Will update as we experience the process*

### About Testing Practices
*Will update as we write tests*

### About the Tech Stack
*Will update as we work with Next.js, Zustand, Zod, etc.*

### About AI Assistance
*Will update with observations about working with AI on iterative projects*
