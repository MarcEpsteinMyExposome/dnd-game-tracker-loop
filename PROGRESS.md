### ✅ Completed Tasks (15/15) 🎉

**Function 5: Dashboard & Statistics** ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **Task 5.1: Create Stats Calculation Utilities** - Created lib/utils/stats.ts with 5 pure functions: calculateTeamSize, calculateAverageHp (rounds to integer), getHealthyCount (>75% HP), getInjuredCount (1-75% HP), getUnconsciousCount (0 HP). All functions handle edge cases (empty arrays, 0 maxHp). Comprehensive JSDoc documentation. Created __tests__/utils/stats.test.ts with 45 tests covering all functions, edge cases, boundary conditions, and integration scenarios. All tests passing. Functions are pure with no side effects.

- [x] **Task 5.2: Create StatCard Component** - Created components/dashboard/StatCard.tsx with full TypeScript props interface. Supports 5 color variants (blue, green, red, yellow, purple) with gradient backgrounds using Tailwind CSS 4 syntax.

Accessible with ARIA labels and semantic HTML. Comprehensive JSDoc documentation explaining all props with examples.

- [x] **Task 5.3: Create Dashboard Component** - Created components/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx integrating all stat cards. Uses Zustand store to access characters and auto-updates when character data changes. Displays: Team Size (blue card), Average HP (color-coded green/yellow/red based on %), Healthy count (green), Injured count (yellow), Unconscious count (red). Responsive grid layout (1-3 columns). Empty state message when no characters exist. Dynamic HP color logic (>75% green, >25% yellow, ≤25% red). Comprehensive JSDoc documentation with usage examples.

- [x] **Task 5.4: Create Dashboard Page** - Created app/dashboard/page.tsx at /dashboard route. Page header with 📊 icon, title "Team Dashboard", and description.

- [x] **Task 5.5: Write Dashboard Component Tests** - Created __tests__/components/dashboard/StatCard.test.tsx with 23 comprehensive tests covering basic rendering, optional props (icon, description, trend), all 5 color variants, accessibility (ARIA labels, roles), and styling. Created __tests__/components/dashboard/Dashboard.test.tsx with 25 tests covering empty state, team size display, average HP with color-coding thresholds (green >75%, yellow 26-75%, red ≤25%), health status breakdown (healthy/injured/unconscious counts), real-time updates when characters change, and layout structure. All 48 new tests passing. Total test count: 367 tests passing.

**Function 6: Combat Tracker - Basic**
- [x] **Task 6.1: Create Combatant Schema Extensions** - Schema already exists from Iteration 1 with all required functionality. Helper functions createCombatantFromCharacter and createCombatantFromMonster work correctly. Initiative defaults to AC (temporary until Iteration 5). Schema validates initiative values (min -10, max 50). All helper functions fully documented with JSDoc. Comprehensive tests exist in __tests__/schemas/combatant.test.ts with 43 passing tests covering schema validation, helper functions, HP calculations, initiative sorting, turn advancement, and edge cases.

- [x] **Task 6.2: Create Combat Zustand Store Slice** - Created lib/store/slices/combatSlice.ts with complete combat management. Actions: addCombatant (validates and auto-sorts by initiative, activates first combatant), removeCombatant (handles active turn transfer), updateCombatantHp (with clamping), setActiveCombatant, nextTurn (skips defeated, increments round counter on cycle), clearCombat, startCombat. Selectors: getActiveCombatant, getSortedCombatants, getCombatantById. State: combatants array, round counter, isInCombat flag. Comprehensive JSDoc documentation with usage examples. Follows established Zustand slice pattern from characterSlice.

- [x] **Task 6.3: Integrate Combat Slice into Main Store** - Updated lib/store/gameStore.ts to include CombatSlice. Extended GameStore interface with CombatSlice. Combined combatSlice with existing characterSlice using spread operator. All combat actions now available via useGameStore hook. DevTools configured to display combat state. TypeScript types properly integrated. Store version remains 1.

- [x] **Task 6.4: Create CombatantCard Component** - Created components/combat/CombatantCard.tsx with combat-optimized display. Features: active turn indicator with gold border and glow effect, initiative badge display, HP bar with color coding (green/yellow/red), quick HP adjustment buttons (-5, -1, +1, +5), player vs enemy visual distinction (blue/red backgrounds), defeated state indicator, condition badges, avatar display with fallback, optional remove button, notes section. Uses Zustand updateCombatantHp action. Streamlined for quick combat reference. Comprehensive JSDoc documentation with usage examples. ARIA labels for accessibility.

- [x] **Task 6.5: Create CombatTracker Component** - Created components/combat/CombatTracker.tsx as main combat management interface. Features: initiative-ordered combatant list with rank numbers, round counter header with gradient styling, current turn display, Next Turn button (auto-skips defeated), End Combat button with confirmation dialog, Add Combatants button, combat status summary (players alive, enemies alive, total count), empty state with call-to-action. Uses Zustand combat actions (nextTurn, clearCombat, removeCombatant, getSortedCombatants). Integrates CombatantCard and ConfirmDialog components. Comprehensive JSDoc documentation with usage examples.

- [x] **Task 6.6: Create Add to Combat Modal** - Created components/combat/AddToCombatModal.tsx for adding characters to combat. Features: character list with avatars and stats, multi-select checkboxes, initiative input field per character (defaults to AC), Select All / Clear All buttons, filters out characters already in combat, empty state when no characters available, selected count display, modal overlay with ESC key and backdrop click support.

Integrates CombatTracker component for combat management. Modal state management for AddToCombatModal. Quick action buttons to navigate to Dashboard and Characters pages. Red-slate gradient background matching combat theme. Updated app/layout.tsx navigation to include Combat link in header. Comprehensive JSDoc documentation with route information.

- [x] **Task 6.8: Implement Turn Management Logic** - Turn management already fully implemented in lib/store/slices/combatSlice.ts (Task 6.2). Logic includes: nextTurn() action that automatically skips defeated combatants (HP=0), cycles through initiative order, increments round counter when returning to first combatant, prevents infinite loops if all defeated. setActiveCombatant() for manual turn setting. getActiveCombatant() selector. CombatTracker component integrates with "Next Turn" button. All turn management requirements satisfied.

## Post-Iteration 3 Bug Fixes

### ✅ RESOLVED: CombatTracker Infinite Loop (2026-01-21)

**Problem:** Application crashed with "The result of getSnapshot should be cached to avoid an infinite loop" error when loading `/combat` page.

**Root Cause:** In CombatTracker.tsx line 51, selector functions `getSortedCombatants()` and `getActiveCombatant()` were being called directly inside Zustand `useGameStore` hook subscriptions. These selectors create new arrays/objects on every call, causing React to detect state changes and trigger infinite re-renders.

**Solution:**
1. Changed to access selector functions themselves from store (not call them during render subscription)
2. Call selector functions outside Zustand subscription, in component body
3. Updated all references from `combatants` to `sortedCombatants`

**Files Fixed:**
- components/combat/CombatTracker.tsx (lines 51-63, 79, 143-157, 170)

**Test Results:**
- ✅ All 435 tests still passing
- ✅ No test changes needed (runtime-only issue)
- ✅ Application loads correctly at `/combat`

## Questions / Decisions Needed

### ✅ RESOLVED: Tailwind CSS 4 Syntax Issue

**Problem:** Homepage at localhost:3001 displayed "undefined Runtime Error" and spun endlessly.

**Root Cause:** Used incorrect Tailwind CSS 4 syntax. The initial fix attempt incorrectly converted slash opacity syntax (`bg-green-900/30`) to old-style explicit opacity classes (`bg-green-900 bg-opacity-30`), which is incompatible with Tailwind 4.

**Solution:** Tailwind CSS 4 **requires** the slash syntax for opacity modifiers. Reverted all opacity classes back to proper Tailwind 4 format:
- `bg-green-900/30` ✓ (correct for Tailwind 4)
- `border-green-500/50` ✓ (correct for Tailwind 4)
- `bg-green-900 bg-opacity-30` ✗ (old Tailwind 3 syntax, incompatible)

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Server running successfully, page loads with 200 status

**Files Fixed:**
- app/page.tsx (all opacity modifiers updated to slash syntax)
